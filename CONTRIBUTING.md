# Contributing to ElegantFin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **ElegantFin**, a custom theme for the Jellyfin Web UI. To keep the project clean, maintainable, and compatible across devices, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

## üß© Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep PRs focused.** Each pull request should address a single feature, bugfix, or improvement. Avoid bundling unrelated changes.

- **Write clear PR descriptions.** Explain what you changed and why. This helps reviewers and future contributors understand the purpose and reasoning behind the change.

- **Provide screenshots.** Include before/after screenshots for any visual changes, along with a short description of what each image shows.

- **Comment your code.** If you‚Äôre adding new CSS rules or modifying complex ones, include inline comments where needed to describe intent.

- **Don't forget responsiveness.** ElegantFin runs on phones, tablets, TVs, and desktops. Ensure your changes are tested across viewports and don't break layouts or interactions on other platforms.

- **Use consistent units.** Follow the theme‚Äôs existing use of relative units such as `em` instead of absolute units like `px`.

- **Avoid `!important`.** Only use it when it is absolutely necessary and no alternative exists.

- **Minimize media queries.** Only add new media queries if there is no simpler or existing solution that achieves the same result.

## üí¨ Propose First for Major Changes

If you are planning to:
- change the overall layout or structure of key components,
- modify the core color scheme,
- or introduce new UI behavioral patterns,

Please open a GitHub issue first to discuss the proposal with maintainers before submitting a PR. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures alignment with the project's goals.

## üìÅ File Structure and Naming

- Follow the existing CSS naming conventions and structure.
- When adding new sections, group related styles logically and use comments to identify the purpose of the block.
